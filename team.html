He has held the position of President while in senior high school. Presently he is on a gap year because he wanted to explore himself better. &#8220;Taking a gap year in India has been such an adventure&#8221;, he said. His vision behind organising TEDxBhilwara is to engage like-minded people in local community and allow space to spark healthy conversations on ideas that matter.</p>

Coding because itâ€™s logical, books because they are the ultimate source of wisdom and writing because it is his mirror. He is fascinated by the wonders technology has done and the way it has changed the way we conduct our lives. He believes that technology has the power to change the world and has witnessed a part of this story in the past decade. He is interested in exploring the possibilities on how can technology be used to make the world a better place for all of us. He is concerned about the crisis that education industry is currently undergoing and our inability to understand it. And he sees MOOCs as the next big explosion in the education industry. He loves sharing ideas and stimulating a discussion with people around him because it is only a well-informed society that makes a decisive world. He wants to open a library, be a teacher and a life-long learner. His mantra: the best way to live your life is to be curious about it. Caution: Human beings are dynamic and I am human. I am not what I was and I will not be what am I.</p>
